# Centro

Centro is an AI-powered sales phone agent SaaS. Companies route their
existing "Press 6 for Sales" phone menu option to Centro, which answers
inbound sales calls, qualifies the caller, collects contact details, scores
the lead, summarizes the call, and transfers qualified leads to a human
sales rep.

The project has two main parts:

- **Marketing site** — explains the product, pricing, and handles sign-up/login.
- **Centro dashboard** — where customers configure their AI agent, phone
  routing, and view calls, transcripts, and leads.
- **Admin app** — internal tool for Centro staff to manage customers,
  companies, subscriptions, and usage.

### Current Blocker

Production authentication issue:

Website:
https://centroengine.com

Issue:
- Local authentication works.
- Production signup/sign-in returns: `ERROR 225175667`

Root cause (confirmed): `centroengine.com` is running Clerk **Development**
keys (`pk_test_.../sk_test_...`). Confirmed directly against the live site —
both `/` and `/sign-in` return `x-clerk-auth-reason: dev-browser-missing` on
every fresh request. Development instances only work natively on
`localhost`; on a real custom domain the required "dev browser" handshake
isn't supported for production traffic and fails, which is what surfaces as
this error. `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is also unset, which independently breaks
the `user.created` webhook (fails closed with a 500, so nothing insecure
happens — the app just falls back to lazily provisioning on first dashboard
visit instead).

Fix required (Clerk Dashboard + Vercel config only, no code changes) — see
[ENVIRONMENT.md § Production instance setup](./ENVIRONMENT.md#production-instance-setup-required-before-a-live-custom-domain-works)
for the exact steps:
1. Create a Clerk **Production** instance and verify `centroengine.com`.
2. Set the new `pk_live_`/`sk_live_` pair in Vercel, scoped to Production.
3. Create a **production** webhook endpoint and set its own
   `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, scoped to Production.
4. Redeploy.

Do not begin AI/Twilio development until production authentication is stable.

## Data model

Multi-tenant: everything hangs off `Company`, and a `User` (synced from
Clerk via `clerkId`) can belong to one or more companies through
`CompanyMember`.

- **User** — one row per Clerk identity; `role` mirrors the Clerk
  `publicMetadata.role` used by auth (see [proxy.ts](./proxy.ts)).
- **Company** — a customer organization using Centro.
- **CompanyMember** — join table linking users to the companies they belong to.
- **AIAgent** — a company's configured AI sales agent (greeting,
  instructions, qualification questions, active/inactive).
- **PhoneIntegration** — a phone number routed to Centro for a company,
  and which provider (currently Twilio only, modeled as an enum so more
  providers can be added later) handles it.
- **Call** — a single inbound call, its transcript and AI-generated summary.
- **Lead** — a qualified opportunity captured from a call, with score and status.

All child tables (`AIAgent`, `PhoneIntegration`, `Call`, `Lead`,
`CompanyMember`) index and cascade-delete on `companyId`/`userId`, so
removing a company or user cleans up its data automatically.

## Phone integration

Centro never replaces a company's own phone system. The flow is:

```
Company phone menu ("Press 6 for Sales")
  -> forwarded to a Centro phone number
  -> Centro AI answers
```

Twilio is configured to call two webhooks (see
[ENVIRONMENT.md](./ENVIRONMENT.md#phone-twilio-voice) for setup):

- **`/api/twilio/incoming-call`** — on each new call: identifies the company
  from the `To` number (`PhoneIntegration`), loads its active `AIAgent`,
  speaks the greeting, and creates a `Call` row.
- **`/api/twilio/call-status`** — on call completion, fills in the `Call`
  row's `duration`.

Both routes are thin: signature verification, form parsing, and TwiML live
in `services/phone/providers/twilio-*`, while company lookup and agent
loading are plain service functions (`services/phone`, `services/ai`) that
know nothing about Twilio. Swapping providers means writing a new
`PhoneProvider` implementation, not touching the routes.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Copy the environment template and fill in your own values (see
   [ENVIRONMENT.md](./ENVIRONMENT.md) for what each variable does and where
   to get it):

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Apply the committed migrations to your database once `DATABASE_URL` is set:

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

   When you change `prisma/schema.prisma` yourself, generate a new migration
   with `npx prisma migrate dev --name <description>` instead (requires
   `SHADOW_DATABASE_URL` — see [ENVIRONMENT.md](./ENVIRONMENT.md)).

4. Seed realistic demo data (a demo company, a demo customer user, inbound
   calls, AI analyses, and opportunities) so the customer dashboard has
   something to show:

   ```bash
   npx prisma db seed
   ```

   Safe to re-run — every row is upserted against a stable id, so seeding
   again updates the same demo records instead of duplicating them. The
   script refuses to run when `NODE_ENV=production`, as a safeguard against
   seeding a live database. See `prisma/seed.ts` for exactly what it creates.

   The seeded demo user has no real Clerk session, so signing in as
   yourself won't show this data automatically (your own sign-in provisions
   its own separate company). To view the seeded data in the dashboard,
   open `npx prisma studio`, find your own `User` row, and add a
   `CompanyMember` row linking your `userId` to `companyId: "seed-demo-company"`.

5. Complete the one-time Clerk Dashboard setup described in
   [ENVIRONMENT.md](./ENVIRONMENT.md#roles-customer--admin) — a session
   token claim for roles, and a webhook endpoint for the `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
   For local development, use the Clerk CLI or a tunnel (e.g. `ngrok`) so
   Clerk can reach `http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/clerk`.

6. Run the dev server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Connecting this project to GitHub

This repo is already initialized locally (`git init` has been run and the
initial commit exists). To push it to GitHub:

1. Create a new, empty repository on GitHub (do **not** initialize it with a
   README, license, or `.gitignore` — this project already has its own).
2. Add it as a remote and push:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-org-or-username>/<repo-name>.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. Verify on GitHub that `.env` and `lib/db/generated` were **not** uploaded
   — both are excluded via `.gitignore`. Only `.env.example` should appear.

## Preparing for Vercel deployment

The project is structured to deploy on Vercel with no custom configuration,
but deployment itself is a separate, explicit step — this section is
preparation only.

When you're ready to deploy:

1. Push the repo to GitHub (above).
2. In Vercel, import the GitHub repository as a new project. Vercel
   auto-detects Next.js — the default build (`next build`) and install
   (`npm install`) commands work as-is.
3. Before the first deploy, add every variable listed in
   [ENVIRONMENT.md](./ENVIRONMENT.md) under Project → Settings →
   Environment Variables, using production credentials (a production
   Postgres `DATABASE_URL`, live OpenAI/Twilio keys, and — critically — a
   Clerk **Production** instance's `pk_live_`/`sk_live_` keys, not the
   `pk_test_`/`sk_test_` pair used for local development. A custom domain
   cannot authenticate against a Development instance; see
   [ENVIRONMENT.md § Production instance setup](./ENVIRONMENT.md#production-instance-setup-required-before-a-live-custom-domain-works)
   for the full walkthrough, including the separate production webhook and
   `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`).
4. `npm install` runs `postinstall` → `prisma generate` automatically on
   Vercel, so the generated Prisma client is always in sync with
   `prisma/schema.prisma` — no manual step needed.
5. Apply committed migrations to the production database with
   `npx prisma migrate deploy` before or as part of the deploy — Vercel
   does not run this automatically.
